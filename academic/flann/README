FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor
searches in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of
algorithms we found to work best for nearest neighbor search and a
system for automatically choosing the best algorithm and optimum
parameters depending on the dataset. 

FLANN is written in C++ and contains bindings for the following
languages: C, MATLAB and Python. The Python bindings will need numpy,
and the MATLAB bindings will need MATLAB installed and with its binaries
directory set into the PATH. If you want to build the MATLAB bindings,
set the environment variable WITH_MATLAB to 1.
